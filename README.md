# wild card argument
* When you don't know how many inputs to pass in a function
* Non-keyword arguments, *args
* Keyword arguments, **kwargs

# Modules
* one of the techniques for following DRY Coding principles
* group similar codes and functions together in a seperate file
* solves the problem file being too lengthy and complex
* can be reused across several programs
* python comes with a lot of modules as well,, pythons standard library.

# Packages
* Collection of modules
* Organnise related modules under one directory
* Initialise a package using __init__.py file

# Practical example
* Create a package for basic text processing for modules for:
    * counting words in a string,
    * Counting characters in a string, 
    * reversing strings 

# Slicing a sequence
* way to extract parts of data structures, like strings, lists, tuples
* Syntax: sequence[start:step:step] (like range)
* default of start: 0, step: 1, stop:last 

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* It is a way to help programmers structure the functionality of your program that would make sense to humans and allow comptuers to run it efficiently.
* Almost all programming languages use this concept.
* It uses "objects" to model real-world entities.

## Key Concepts
* Class
    * A blueprint for creating objects.
    * Defines a set of attributes or methods that the created object (instances) will have
    * E.g. blueprint provided while building a house, defining what an animal is
* Objects
    * An instance of a class
    * It represents a specific entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by a class
    * e.g. a built house with many features (functions)
    * e.g. class_eg(dog)
